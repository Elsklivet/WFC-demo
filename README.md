Demonstration of basic use of wave function collapse for explanatory purposes.

This branch is a simple huristic written in python, the rules are, numbers in tiles may not be more than $\pm 1$ away from its predecessor.

If interested, you can:
- make the algo run independently from relative position in map
- apply more complex adjcency rules
- explore iterative solutions
- explore generation of larger areas
